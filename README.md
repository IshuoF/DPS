# DPS

DPS (Dementia Prediction System) is designed to predict dementia using the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale, incorporating both visual and verbal features. 
The CDR scale ranges from zero to three: no dementia (CDR = 0), very mild dementia (CDR = 0.5), mild dementia (CDR = 1), 
moderate dementia (CDR = 2), and severe dementia (CDR = 3). For this project, we focus on predictions within the range of zero to two.
